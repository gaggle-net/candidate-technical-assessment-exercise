# Requirements
Please complete the assignment using the following criteria. It is expected that you wil fork this repository in GitHub and share the link with us when complete.

Assume there is a database of your choice (can be relational or non-relational and the use of an embedded database is acceptable) with records that have the following fields:

Write the code for a Web Service that provides two possible operations for a client to call:
* Get a contact by ID

* Both the input and output of the operations should be formatted in JSON.
* Unit tests for the provided code are written
* **Bonus:** Leverage dependency injection
