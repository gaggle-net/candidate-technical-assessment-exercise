    /*
        Things I want to test and/or build for:

        --- from the requirements specifically:
            - accepts a number; subsequently searches on Primary Key
            - accepts a string; subsequently searches for person with all or part of that input
            - input and output is well-formed JSON

        --- additional thoughts and 'of course ya should' tests:
            - doesn't fail (fatally) on empty string search
            - doesn't fail (fatally) on all symbols (sorry, Prince--next release!)

        --- more thoughts--and questions at the moment--to consider:
            - what is returned when no records found?
            - what is returned on invalid inputs? or just no execute for now/first pass...
