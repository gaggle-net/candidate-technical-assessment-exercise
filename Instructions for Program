The program was made on the IDE Eclipse. 

There is an embedded JSON file with people that have an ID and name in JSON format.

You will find a package name "exercise" in the src folder.

In the package there are three classes: ReadJSONFile. returnData. returnDataTest.

ReadJSONFile: In this class, the JSON file is read and parsed. 
This class also takes in user input. 0 is to exit the program. 1 to use the program to search for a person.
If the user enters 1, the user will be prompted to either enter a name or ID of the person to search for.
This will implement the next class: returnData. 

returnData: In this class, user input will be cleaned and compared to data in the JSON file. If they match, it will
rturn the JSON Object. The user will be asked if they would like to continue or exit.

Finally, the last class is the returnDataTest. You will find 24 tests that have been passed by the program. 
Of the 24 test cases, they can be chunked into a couple of cateogories:

Testing the search for each person by....
1. Name
2. ID
3. Name with white space and weird casing
4. ID with white space
5. Without their full name
6. Non-existing names
7. Non-existing ID
